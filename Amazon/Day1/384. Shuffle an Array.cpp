// Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle Algorithm works in O(n) time complexity. The assumption here is, we are given a function rand() that generates a random number in O(1) time. The idea is to start from the last element and swap it with a randomly selected element from the whole array (including the last). Now consider the array from 0 to n-2 (size reduced by 1), and repeat the process till we hit the first element. 
    Solution(vector<int>& nums) {
        v=nums;
        n=v.size();

            int r=rand() % pointer;
            swap(copy[i],copy[r]);
